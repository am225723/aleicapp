You are working in the ALEIC mobile app repo (aleicapp-main). Implement Option A: move Love Language results storage + retrieval to Supabase (consistent with Attachment + Enneagram). Do NOT rely on Express API routes (/api/love-language). Goal: ensure Love Language quiz results are reliably stored and displayed.

SCOPE
- Create a Supabase table to store Love Language results (new migration).
- Add RLS policies following the same pattern used by attachment_results and enneagram_results.
- Update the LoveLanguageQuizScreen to read/write directly to Supabase.
- Keep the existing UI flow intact unless minor tweaks are necessary.
- Ensure TypeScript passes and the app runs.

FILES/AREAS TO TOUCH
1) Database migration:
- Add a new SQL migration under: aleicapp-main/supabase/migrations/
Name it with a timestamp prefix like: 20260120_love_language_results.sql

Create table: love_language_results
Recommended columns:
- id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid()
- created_at timestamptz not null default now()
- user_id uuid not null references auth.users(id) on delete cascade
- couple_id uuid null (if your app uses it like other results tables; match existing patterns)
- primary_language text not null
- scores jsonb not null (store 5-language score breakdown)
- answers jsonb null (store raw answers if needed)
Indexes:
- index on (user_id, created_at desc)
- index on (couple_id, created_at desc) if couple_id is used elsewhere

RLS:
- Enable RLS on love_language_results.
- Policies should mirror attachment_results/enneagram_results:
  - Allow authenticated users to INSERT rows where user_id = auth.uid()
  - Allow authenticated users to SELECT their own rows (user_id = auth.uid())
  - If partner viewing is supported in your app: allow SELECT where couple_id matches a couple the user belongs to (use the same helper/join logic already used in other policies). If no such pattern exists, at minimum allow own rows.

2) App code:
Update: aleicapp-main/client/screens/couple/LoveLanguageQuizScreen.tsx

Remove all usage of:
- apiRequest("POST", "/api/love-language", ...)
- useQuery calls hitting "/api/love-language/user"

Replace with Supabase usage like other assessments:
- Use supabase.from("love_language_results").select(...).eq("user_id", profile.id).order("created_at", { ascending: false }).limit(1).single()
- On completion, compute scores + primary_language and insert:
  supabase.from("love_language_results").insert({
    user_id: profile.id,
    couple_id: profile.couple_id ?? null (only if profile contains couple_id),
    primary_language,
    scores,
    answers
  })

Behavior requirements:
- When the screen loads, if a latest result exists, display it (same behavior as existingResult).
- After completing the quiz, save to Supabase, then show results immediately.
- Handle loading/error states gracefully (do not crash if no result exists).
- Ensure the quiz can be retaken and creates a new row (don’t overwrite).

3) Optional: remove dead code
- If there are now-unused server routes or hooks specific to /api/love-language, do NOT delete them unless they are clearly unused and safe to remove. Prefer leaving server stubs.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST
- Running the Love Language quiz saves a row in love_language_results.
- Reopening the screen fetches the latest result and displays it.
- TypeScript builds with no errors.
- No runtime errors when profile is null or couple_id is missing.
- RLS allows the authenticated user to insert and read their own rows.

DELIVERABLES
- Implement the migration + policies.
- Update LoveLanguageQuizScreen.tsx to use Supabase directly.
- Add a short note in /docs/SCREEN_PARITY_REPORT.md (or create it if missing) explaining Love Language storage is now Supabase-based like attachment + enneagram.
