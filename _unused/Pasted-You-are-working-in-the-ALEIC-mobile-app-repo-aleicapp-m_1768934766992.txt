You are working in the ALEIC mobile app repo (aleicapp-main). Implement the missing pages compared to the reference (couplestherapy-main) AND also implement the admin pages (admin-dashboard, therapist-management, user-management) as a web/admin-only section inside the same repo.

HARD REQUIREMENTS
- Do NOT break the existing mobile app navigation (5 tabs: Home, Connect, Activities, Plan, Profile).
- Add missing screens as new React Native screens under client/screens/** and wire them into React Navigation.
- Admin pages must NOT appear in mobile tab navigation. Put them behind an Admin-only route group and require an admin role check.
- Use Supabase as the data layer (consistent with existing screens). Prefer direct supabase queries from the client for read operations where safe, otherwise use Supabase Edge Functions for privileged/admin operations.
- Create SQL migrations for any new tables needed. Add RLS policies.
- Ensure TypeScript passes. No runtime errors.

REFERENCE SOURCE OF TRUTH
Use the reference implementation (couplestherapy-main) to match screen purpose and general layout sections:
- reference pages listed below (analytics, checkin-history, etc.)
- use the question/setup and UX patterns from the reference
However, exact visual styling can remain ALEIC’s theme.

DELIVERABLES
1) Implement the following missing screens (mobile):
   - AnalyticsScreen
   - CheckinHistoryScreen
   - MoodTrackerScreen
   - SettingsScreen (client settings)
   - ConflictResolutionScreen
   - CompatibilityScreen
   - GrowthPlanScreen
   - ProgressTimelineScreen
   - DailySuggestionScreen
   - ChoreChartScreen
   - CoupleSetupScreen (partner linking flow)

2) Implement the following admin web pages (admin-only):
   - AdminDashboardScreen (admin-dashboard.tsx equivalent)
   - TherapistManagementScreen (therapist-management.tsx equivalent)
   - UserManagementScreen (user-management.tsx equivalent)

3) Add docs:
   - /docs/MISSING_SCREENS_IMPLEMENTED.md
     Include: screen name, route, what it does, data tables used, and any assumptions.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

A) AnalyticsScreen (mobile)
Path: client/screens/couple/AnalyticsScreen.tsx
Route: Analytics
What it does:
- Displays usage analytics for a couple: tools used, frequency, last used, trends.

F) CompatibilityScreen (mobile)
Path: client/screens/tools/CompatibilityScreen.tsx
Route: Compatibility
What it does:
- Compatibility assessment comparing partner answers.

  id, created_at, couple_id, user_id, answers jsonb, scores jsonb, summary text
If partner comparison is too complex, store each user’s answers and show “awaiting partner” state.
UI:
- Question flow (can be forced-choice or scale)
- Results summary + category scores

G) GrowthPlanScreen (mobile)
Path: client/screens/couple/GrowthPlanScreen.tsx
Route: GrowthPlan

I) DailySuggestionScreen (mobile)
Path: client/screens/couple/DailySuggestionScreen.tsx
Route: DailySuggestion

ADMIN PAGES (ADMIN-ONLY, NOT IN MOBILE TABS)

L) AdminDashboardScreen (web/admin-only)
Path: client/screens/admin/AdminDashboardScreen.tsx
Route group: AdminStack.AdminDashboard
Access:
- Only allow users with role="admin"
Role data:
- Use a user_roles table or claims; if none exists, create user_roles:
  user_id uuid pk references auth.users, role text
Admin operations:
- Use Edge Functions for privileged reads/updates to avoid exposing admin-wide data via client RLS bypass.
UI:
- System totals: total users, couples, therapists
- Recent signups list
- Quick links to therapist management + user management

M) TherapistManagementScreen (web/admin-only)
Path: client/screens/admin/TherapistManagementScreen.tsx
Route: AdminStack.TherapistManagement
Features:
- List therapists
- Approve/disable therapist accounts
- Set therapist attributes (name, status)
Implementation:
- Prefer Edge Function: admin-therapists (list/update)

N) UserManagementScreen (web/admin-only)
Path: client/screens/admin/UserManagementScreen.tsx
Route: AdminStack.UserManagement
Features:
- List users/couples
- Disable user access (soft disable flag)
- View basic metadata (created_at, role)
Implementation:
- Prefer Edge Function: admin-users (list/update)

NAVIGATION
- Add new mobile routes to existing navigators (Home stack, Tools stack, Auth stack) as appropriate.
- Add a separate AdminStack navigator that is only reachable from a hidden entry point:
  - Example: in ProfileScreen add an “Admin” button only if role=admin.
- Ensure admin screens do not render for non-admins (show “Not authorized”).

MIGRATIONS
- Add necessary SQL migrations under supabase/migrations.
- Enable RLS and add policies for all new tables.
- For admin-wide data, do NOT rely solely on client-side RLS if it would expose global lists. Use Edge Functions.

EDGE FUNCTIONS (if needed)
- ai-daily-suggestion
- admin-users
- admin-therapists
Implement minimal, secure versions.

QUALITY CHECKS
- Ensure no TypeScript errors.
- Ensure navigation routes compile.
- Ensure all screens have loading + error states.
- Ensure no secrets are hardcoded.
